# Surfs_up      Module 9

### Cheryl Berger

## 1.	Overview of the Surfs_Up Analysis
W. Avy is interested in the weather temperatures during the calendar year in Ohau so that he knows when to open his ice cream shop.  He has asked Surfs_up Inc. to compare temperatures in the summer to the winter temperatures to determine if it would be lucrative to reamain open all year long.  Using the the recent weather data found in file Hawaiii.sqlite https://github.com/cherylberger/Surfs_up/commit/56f426f175677560eba267b43b0a7858cbc551ce, the weather for the months of June and December will be queried and organized for comparison.  Three key differences in the weather results will be highlighted for W. Avy's consideration.  A summary of the results will be provided along with recommendations for additional analysis. 

## 2.	Surfs_Up Analysis and Results: 

### 2a. Connect to the Database and gather tools and methods to perfom the analysis
        
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, filter the column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures           for the month of June. Load all dependencies and import the required functions as displayed in the code block from file https://github.com/cherylberger/Surfs_up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb. Create the base engine to connect Python to the database and reflect the Measurement table to ensure the connection has been made.

### 2c. Determine the Summary Statistics for the month of December

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, youâ€™ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the             temperatures for the month of December. The dependencies were loaded in Step 1 before analyzing the Juen results, the same dependencies and functions will be needed             again for the analysis of the December data.  The code detailed below was added to new code blocks in                         https://github.com/cherylberger/Surfs_up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb.

### Summary of Key Differences 

####    #1:  Average Temperatures June vs December

The average temperatures measured 74.9F in June and 72.0F in December, with June temperatures averaging approximately 7% higher than December. The data appears normally distributed and largely centralized around the mean for both June and December.  Hpwever, the frequency of temperatures between 71F and 80F in June was similar for the years measured comparison of the results using a histogram shows that during both June and December, the mean and mode are near in both datasets.  The frequency of cool days, below the December average of 71F is less than  

#####    Comparison of Summary Statistics


####    #2:  Range of Temperatures June vs December
    
In June, temperatures were observed in the range of 64 6p 85F, oompared to 56 to 83F in December. The lowest temperature observed in December was 56F compared to 64F in June. Interestingly, the maximum temperature in June was 85F compared to 83F in December, clearly there are still very warm days in December in Oahu, Hawaii!

####    #3:  Sample size by Month
    
Once the query results were compiled into a convenient datatable using Pandas, a row count was generated for the both the June (june_df) and December (dec_df) DataFrames.  There were less data points (rows) in the December results, a total n=1517 compared to n=1700 for June. The reason for the missing data is not clear from the results.  There are 183 missing values in the December data which represents about 1% of the total data points for June (1700).  The missing datapoints are not likey to impact the overall conclusions as the December data appears to be normally distributed, the standard deviation is small and the results have no obvious outliers.     


## 3.	Summary of the Surfs_Up Analysis: 

### High Level Summary
Based on the temperature analysis, the average temperatures are above 70F in both June and December and the difference in average temperatures is less than 10%.  Although there may be some cooler days in December, observed temperatures would not be expected to dip below the statistical average +/- 3 st.dev or rougly 62F during the month of December based on historical data.  Based on the assumption that average daily temperatures for Juen and December are predictive of the weather year-round and that warm temperatures are better for the ice createm businees, the results of the analysis suggest that keeping the ice cream stand open year round would be profitable.   
   
### Additional Query 1  
Although temperatures may be pleasant for most or all of the calendar year in Oahu; it would be useful to gather precipitation results for each month of the year and determine if there are trends in precipitation amounts during the calendar year.  Also look for trends across the entire dataset, make a note of any typhoons or other events that impacted the weather in Oahu.  Although storms are not always predicatable, most geographic regions have similar weather patterns from year to year.  Rainy months or series of months were high ampunts of precipition are observed may preclude visits to the beach and/or influence the typical beach-goers desire for ice cream.  Comparing precipitation or temperatures from the last five years to the current analysis may be helpful in identifying more subtle trends.  It may be useful to conduct research on operating schedules for similar business on the Island before finalizing the annual operating plans for the new ice cream shop.   

### Additional Query 2  
There is an additional dataset available to Surfs_up Inc, the Stations datatable.  Weather information contained in this database provides additional measurements such as station name, location, wind speed measurements and possibly the time of day for tidal influences. These data could be analyzed to identify useful data and then filtered by location throughout the regions of the Island. Comparisons between individual or groups of weather station may be useful to determine if there are any trends in weather conditions by location on the Island.  This query could may also be useful in determining the best location for placement of the ice cream shop if the coorelation to weather remains the best predictor of business success.
