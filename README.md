# Surfs_up      Module 9

### Cheryl Berger


## 1.	Overview of the Surfs_Up Analysis
W. Avy is interested in the weather temperatures during the year in Ohau so that he knows when to open his ice cream shop.  He has asked XXX to compare temperatures in the summer to the winter temperatures to determine if it would be lucrative to reamain open all year long.  Using the the recent weather data found in file Hawaiii.sqlite https://github.com/cherylberger/Surfs_up/commit/56f426f175677560eba267b43b0a7858cbc551ce, the weather for the months of June and December will be queried and organized for comparison.  Three key differences in the weather results will be highlighted for W. Avy's consideration.  A summary of the results will be provided along with recommendations for additional analysis. 

## 2.	Surfs_Up Analysis and Results: 

### 2a. Connect to the Database and gather tools and methods to perfom the analysis
        
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, filter the column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures           for the month of June. Load all dependencies and import the required functions as displayed in the code block from file https://github.com/cherylberger/Surfs_up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb. Create the base engine to connect Python to the database and reflect the Measurement table to ensure the connection has been made.

### 2c. Determine the Summary Statistics for the month of December

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, youâ€™ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the             temperatures for the month of December. The dependencies were loaded in Step 1 before analyzing the Juen results, the same dependencies and functions will be needed             again for the analysis of the December data.  The code detailed below was added to new code blocks in                         https://github.com/cherylberger/Surfs_up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb.

### Summary of Key Differences 

####    * #1:  Average Temperatures June vs December

The average temperatures measured 74.9F in June and 72.0F in December, with June temperatures averaging approximately 7% higher than December. The data appears normally          distributed based on the analysis of central theorum.  Most of the data points were within the upper quartiles and the standard deviation was similiar for each month            queried, at just about 3F.   

####    * #2:  Range of Temperatures June vs December
    
The lowest temperature observed in December was 56F compared to 64F in June. Interestingly, the maximum temperature in June was 85F compared to 83F in December.  

 
####    * #3:  Sample size by Month
    
Less data points in the December results. 1517 compared to 1700 for June. The reason for the missing data is not clear from the results but is not likey to impact the           overall conclusions as the data is well behaved.    


## 3.	Summary of the Surfs_Up Analysis: 

#### High Level Summary
Based on the temperature analysis, the 
   
#### Additional Query 1  
Gather precipitation results for each month of the year and determine if there is a month or series of months were high precipition would preclude beach-goers desire for         ice cream.  

#### Additional Query 2  
Compare temperatures from each weather station to determine if location on the Island impacts either the temperature or the amount of precipitation.
Also look for trends across the entire dataset, were their storms or other events that impacted the weather in Oahu?
